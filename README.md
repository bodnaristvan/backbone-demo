Backbone-demo
=============
This project was a Backbone.js assignment from [Gawker Media](http://gawker.com/) as a part of interview process.

1. When closing the comment edit form without saving after text was changed, ask the user for confirmation if he really wants to lose changes!

2. Make sure that only one comment form can be opened on the page simultaneously. Before opening the new form close the existing one, combined with the solution from the previous question.

3. Convert the comment form to a modal window, clicking outside the form container should close the form!

4. Display an error if the comment text or author field is left empty!

5. Store the name of author of the last submitted comment, use the name the next time the form is opened!

==
Backbone-demo is a simple JS application to show you the basics of Backbone models, collections and views.
